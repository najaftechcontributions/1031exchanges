                        <h3 class="case-title">Example: Transitioning to a Passive Investment</h3>
                        <p class="case-text">An investor is looking to retire from active property management and owns a rental property with a $400,000 capital gain and a tax liability of $80,000. Through a 1031 exchange, the investor acquires a stake in a Delaware Statutory Trust (DST) that owns a portfolio of managed properties.</p>
                        <div class="case-benefit">
                            <strong>Tax Benefit:</strong> The investor defers the $80,000 in capital gains tax and shifts to a passive investment, eliminating day-to-day management responsibilities while maintaining income flow.
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="case-note">
                <p>In each example, the primary tax benefit is the deferral of capital gains tax, which allows the investor to leverage the full amount of their equity into the next investment. This deferral can significantly increase an investor's purchasing power and compound wealth over time. It's essential to note that these examples are simplified, and actual tax liabilities would depend on specific circumstances and current tax laws.</p>

                            There is no set holding period required by the IRS for a property to qualify, but the property should be held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment. A minimum of one to two years is commonly recommended to satisfy this requirement.

                            No, if you receive cash, it's considered boot and is taxable. To fully defer capital gains tax, you must reinvest all equity into the replacement property and you cannot receive "constructive receipt" of the funds during the exchange.
